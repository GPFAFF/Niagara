              <h3> We are more than just hockey!</h3>
              <h6> Why you should choose Niagara Sports Tournaments over all the others</h6>
              <h6> The answers are clear, read below to see more about us and the attractions, restaurants and exemplary service that we provide. </h6>
  
  <p>Gene Carella, NST Tournament Director, has been presenting tournament opportunities since 1990 for what was formerly known as Grand Niagara Cataracts Hockey Association. In 1999 he started Niagara Sport tournaments to help provide youth hockey to hundreds of teams throughout the U.S. and Canada per year.  Gene also raised four hockey players, and through his travels to many tournaments, he understands what hockey parents want. Gene and his son Michael put all teams through a rigorous screening process to ensure each team is placed in the proper division. Since there are many different classifications used by amateur hockey teams in different regions of the United States, and Canada, we at NST take the time and effort to create well balanced divisions. Nothing is more disheartening then driving to a tournament to blow out a team or get blown out by a team.  Teams also do not want to travel to a tournament just to be place in the same side of a division as team from their local leagues.  Gene and Mike take great pride in delivering an enjoyable tournament experience for our tournament families. This is evidenced by an incredible return rate in tournament participation by hockey associations. We only accept between 40-50 teams per tournament to ensure each division of each tournament has balanced competition.  We believe in quality over quantity when it comes to our tournaments.</p>
  <p>Niagara Sports Tournaments Inc. prides itself in offering a complete family mini vacation surrounding a first class, well managed, competitive hockey tournament. We will make the tournament registration/hotel selection process fast and easy for you.</p>

                 <h1> Rules: </h1>
                 <p> All U.S.A. Hockey Rules and Regulations will be applicable. Tournament Rules are posted on our website under the tournament rules link. Please note that all of our tournament are ran on a point-per-period scoring system, where each game is worth 5 points which will be divided between the two teams.</p>

                 <h1> Registration: </h1>
                 <p> All U.S. and Canadian Teams must be registered with their respective parent organizations for the 2012-2013 season. Only U.S.A. hockey age classifications will be accepted. A certified U.S.A. or C.A.H.A. Hockey Team roster will be required before final acceptance is granted. It must also be presented at registration check in.</p>

                 <h1> Level of Competition: </h1>
                 <p> Classification systems (AAA, AA, A, B, AE, house select & house) may have slightly different meanings from area to area. Expect to encounter teams that may have different eligibility or classification rules that may not correspond to what you are accustomed to in your area. The age groups for USA Hockey and those of the Canadian Hockey Association are basically the same, however areas that have large numbers of registered players tend to further delineate within the 2 year window allowed for each age group. In these situations, teams composed of exclusively or primarily of players in their 1st year of eligibility of a particular age group, will play in their respective home areas against like teams.</p>
                 <h1> Here are a few examples: </h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>New York has areas that use both the two year USA Hockey age window and the single calendar year to determine the make-up of their teams. There are also teams that travel from New York who are rostered as B/travel.</li>
                    <li>Ontario has many more skill classification, per calendar year age grouping, than any USA Hockey affiliate. These include AAA, AA, A, BB, B, AE (additional entry) and House. Many governing bodies within Ontario also permits Select or All-Star teams to form for the sole purpose of competing in events.</li>
                    <li>Cleveland Suburban League uses the RPI system, and classifies teams as AA, A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2. </li>
                    <li>In Massachusetts, teams are classified A, B, and C with the exception of the Boston Metro League. </li>
                    <li>In Michigan they’re referred to as “A” teams, in Ontario & Western New York they are referred to as “minor” teams. Michigan is still the only place in the universe, to our knowledge, where the A & AA classification are age groups and not skill levels. </li>
                    <li>Ohio is growing their hockey programs rapidly, but there are not the concentrations of players you'll find in Michigan or Illinois and therefore the talent is also spread out. Each season we see additional ice arenas being built, added to, or renovated in Ohio. With the addition of the Blue Jackets in Columbus, it's only a matter of time.</li>
                    <li>Indiana like Ohio, suffers from a lack of ice arenas. Again there are several programs across the state and new arenas are being built each season. House program teams in Indiana do not travel to tournaments. Programs in Indiana typically form an All Star team from their house programs which either compete in the B or A brackets of our events.</li>
                    <li>Florida also has an interesting way of organizing youth hockey. A & AA teams are typically designated as such depending on the league you choose. For instance, teams playing in the Central Florida Hockey League are all designated A teams with those teams playing in the statewide league designated as AA teams. In addition, a team can be formed in Florida for the sole purpose of attending a tournament and these teams are rostered as tournament teams.</li>
                 <h1> Playing Levels - Boys Teams </h1>
                 <p>      Our tournament divisions are based on the following general guidelines. Variations are possible based on the skill level of specific teams: </p>
                 <ul>
                   <li> AA - The "best" or first picked travel team within a Tier II organization. These teams will often consist primarily of "second year" or "major" aged players within the age group. In some cases, Major A teams are also a more appropriate fit for this level. </li>
                   <li> A - The second team or lower teams within a hockey organization and/or teams consisting Primarily of "first year" players within the age classification or "minor" teams of a suitable skill level. </li>
                   <li> B - The third, or lower, travel level teams chosen within a Tier II organization or teams that are classified as Tier III. Teams at the B levels may often be populated by many players in their first year of "travel" hockey. </li>
                  </ul>

                 <h1> Playing Levels - Girls Teams </h1>

                    <ul>
                      <li> AA - Top competitive team in an association or district. </li>
                      <li> A -  Competitive travel teams that are tournament bound. </li>
                      <li> B -  Recreational/House/Travel teams that are not tournament bound. </li>
                      <li> C -  Developmental teams - Teams that mainly comprised of first year players with no more than 20% returning players </li>
                    </ul>

                 <h1> Playing Levels - High School </h1>
                    <p> Junior Varsity / Varsity </p>
                    <p> Age divisions and classifications may vary between the U.S. and Canada and, in some cases, from state to state. The tournament director will discuss appropriate placement of all teams to insure fair, competitive and equitable playing divisions. </p>


                 <h1> Accommodation Policy </h1>
                 <p> Teams are required to stay at one of the approved host hotels. A list of approved hotels will be sent as soon as the entry fee is received. The reservation committee will book all team rooms. Teams are not allowed to book their own reservations. It is suggested that team managers/coaches respond quickly since there are limited rooms available at each hotel. Call for further information. </p>

                 <p> Please note - Teams that do not stay at approved hotels will be removed from the tournament and forfeit their entry fees. </p>

                 <p> Please complete the electronic registration. The application will not be processed until the entry fee is received. Applications are taken in the order they are received. Full payment must be included in U.S. funds. </p>

                 <p> A CERTIFIED BANK CHECK OR ASSOCIATION CHECK SHOULD BE USED. </p>
