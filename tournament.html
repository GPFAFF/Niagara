            <h3 class="info-title">About NST</h3>
            <p>
              Thank you for looking at NST for your Tournament needs. We
              appreciate your consideration, as I know how difficult it can be
              to pick the proper tournament with all the choices out there
              today. Gene Carella, NST Co-Tournament Director, has been
              presenting tournament opportunities since 1990 for what was
              formerly known as Grand Niagara Cataracts Hockey Association. In
              1999, he started Niagara Sport Tournaments to help provide youth
              hockey to hundreds of teams throughout the U.S. and Canada per
              year. Gene also raised four hockey players, and through his
              travels to many tournaments, he understands what hockey parents’
              want. Gene's son Michael now runs the company but still has the
              same goal as his father, which is to make sure that every player
              has a great time win or loss. Hockey is a GAME where the end
              result should be smiling kids who don't even realize the life
              lessons they are learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I (Michael) have been to many tournaments in my playing and
              coaching days where what was advertised was not what we got. For
              example, I remember a tournament where our AA Minor Bantam teams
              was playing in the same division as AAA Major Bantams! The
              tournament director was nowhere to be found, and the staff that
              was there could not help solve this problem. In a different
              tournament, the schedule that was sent a week before the
              tournament, was changed the DAY before the tournament started,
              which completely change our hotel and other plans we had outside
              of the tournament. This will not happen at NST. I personally am
              present for EVERY game of the tournament so if you need to find me
              you can and the schedule is send out 3-4 weeks before the
              tournament.
            </p>
            <p>
              I put all teams through a rigorous screening process to ensure
              each team is placed in the proper division. As you may know there
              is no exact science to paring teams. Since there are many
              different classifications used by amateur hockey teams in
              different regions of the United States, and Canada (see Screening
              process tab above). Divisions can get messy if careful
              consideration is not taken. We at NST, take much time and effort
              to create well-balanced divisions. Nothing is more disheartening
              then driving to a tournament to blow out a team or get blown out
              by a team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teams also do not want to travel to a tournament just to be place
              in the same side of a division as team from their local leagues.
              My father and I take great pride in delivering an enjoyable
              tournament experience for our tournament families. This is
              evidenced by an incredible return rate in tournament participation
              by hockey associations. We only accept between 40-60 teams per
              tournament. This wide range in number of teams ensures each
              division of each tournament has balanced competition. We will not
              force a division together just to fill ice! We believe in quality
              over quantity when it comes to our tournaments.

                USA hockey sanctioned tournament. ALL players must be recognized
                by USA hockey or C.A.H.A/ OMHA. The use of any illegal or
                unauthorized played will result in immediate team expulsion from

                on team’s sheet before first game.
              </li>

                (13) in Midget divisions. No time outs are allowed in regular
                division games. A maximum of one minute will be given between
                periods in all games. A delay of game penalty will be given if
                teams exceed that time. This is to ensure that game times stay
                on schedule during the tournament.
              </li>
              <li>
                Minor penalties shall be 2 minutes (1.5 minutes for mites and

                with USA Hockey. Upon receiving a Match Penalty, the PLAYER,
                COACH OR MANAGER will be suspended for the duration of the
                tournament. A Match Penalty hearing will take place prior to the
                end of the tournament. The PLAYER, COACH OR MANAGER charged will
                be notified of time and place of hearing for which they must be
                present. The Coach or Manager must come into the registration

                the hearing. The hearing committee will include the Supervisor

                the Home organization and the PLAYER, COACH OR MANAGER who
                received the match penalty. The hearing decision will be made
                prior to the conclusion of said tournament. It is the coach's
                responsibility to have this decision in hand before the
                tournament ends.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any penalty for fighting or match penalty given will result in

            <h3 class="info-title">Screening Process</h3>
            <h4 class="info-header">Rules:</h4>
            <p>
              All U.S.A. Hockey Rules and Regulations will be applicable.
              Tournament Rules are posted on our website under the tournament
              rules link. Please note that all of our tournaments are run on a
              point-per-period scoring system, where each game is worth 5 points
              which will be divided between the two teams.
            </p>
            <h4 class="info-header">Registration:</h4>
            <p>
              All U.S. and Canadian Teams must be registered with their
              respective parent organizations for the 2015-2016 season. Only
              U.S.A. hockey age classifications will be accepted. A certified
              U.S.A. or C.A.H.A. Hockey Team roster will be required before
              final acceptance is granted. It must also be presented at
              registration check-in.
            </p>
            <h4 class="info-header">Level of Competition:</h4>
            <p>
              Classification systems (AAA, AA, A, B, AE, house select & house)
              may have slightly different meanings from area to area. Expect to
              encounter teams that may have different eligibility or
              classification rules that may not correspond to what you are
              accustomed to in your area. The age groups for USA Hockey and
              those of the Canadian Hockey Association are basically the same,
              however, areas that have large numbers of registered players tend
              to further delineate within the 2-year window allowed for each age
              group. In these situations, teams composed of exclusively or
              primarily of players in their 1st year of eligibility of a
              particular age group will play in their respective home areas
              against like teams.
            </p>
            <h4 class="info-header">Examples:</h4>
            <p>
              New York has areas that use both the two year USA Hockey age
              window and the single calendar year to determine the make-up of
              their teams. There are also teams that travel from New York who
              are rostered as B/travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ontario has much more skill classification, per the calendar year
              age grouping than any USA Hockey affiliate. These include AAA, AA,
              A, BB, B, AE (additional entry) and House. Many governing bodies
              within Ontario also permits Select or All-Star teams to form for
              the sole purpose of competing in events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleveland Suburban League uses the RPI system and classifies teams
              as AA, A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Massachusetts, teams are classified A, B, and C with the
              exception of the Boston Metro League.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Michigan they’re referred to as “A” teams, in Ontario & Western
              New York they are referred to as “minor” teams. Michigan is still
              the only place in the universe, to our knowledge, where the A & AA
              classifications are age groups and not skill levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ohio is growing their hockey programs rapidly, but there are not
              the concentrations of players you'll find in Michigan or Illinois
              and therefore the talent is also spread out. Each season we see
              additional ice arenas being built, added to or renovated in Ohio.
              With the addition of the Blue Jackets in Columbus, it's only a
              matter of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indiana like Ohio suffers from a lack of ice arenas. Again there
              are several programs across the state and new arenas are being
              built each season. House program teams in Indiana do not travel to
              tournaments. Programs in Indiana typically form an All-Star team
              from their house programs which either compete in the B or A
              brackets of our events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Florida also has an interesting way of organizing youth hockey. A
              & AA teams are typically designated as such depending on the
              league you choose. For instance, teams playing in the Central
              Florida Hockey League are all designated A teams with those teams
              playing in the statewide league designated as AA teams. In
              addition, a team can be formed in Florida for the sole purpose of
              attending a tournament and these teams are rostered as tournament
              teams.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">Playing Levels - Boys Teams</h3>
            <p>
              Our tournament divisions are based on the following general
              guidelines. Variations are possible based on the skill level of
              specific teams:
            </p>
            <p>
              AA - The "best" or first picked travel team within a Tier II
              organization. These teams will often consist primarily of
              "second-year" or "major" aged players within the age group. In
              some cases, Major A teams are also a more appropriate fit for this
              level.
            </p>
            <p>
              A - The second team or lower teams within a hockey organization
              and/or teams consisting Primarily of "first-year" players within
              the age classification or "minor" teams of a suitable skill level.
            </p>
            <p>
              B - The third, or lower, travel level teams chosen within a Tier
              II organization or teams that are classified as Tier III. Teams at
              the B levels may often be populated by many players in their first
              year of "travel" hockey.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">Playing Levels - Girls Teams</h3>
            <p>AA - Top competitive team in an association or district.</p>
            <p>A - Competitive travel teams that are tournament bound.</p>
            <p>
              B - Recreational/House/Travel teams that are not tournament bound.
            </p>
            <p>
              C - Developmental teams - Teams that mainly comprised of
              first-year players with no more than 20% returning players
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">
              Playing Levels - High School - Varsity / JV
            </h3>
            <p>
              Age divisions and classifications may vary between the U.S. and
              Canada and, in some cases, from state to state. The tournament
              director will discuss appropriate placement of all teams to ensure
              fair, competitive and equitable playing divisions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">Accomodation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Teams are required to stay at one of the approved host hotels. A
              list of approved hotels will be sent as soon as the entry fee is
              received. The reservation committee will book all team rooms.
              Teams are not allowed to book their own reservations. It is
              suggested that team managers/coaches respond quickly since there
              are limited rooms available at each hotel. Call for further
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note - Teams that do not stay at approved hotels will be
              removed from the tournament and forfeit their entry fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please complete the electronic registration. The application will
              not be processed until the entry fee is received. Applications are
              taken in the order they are received. Full payment must be
              included in U.S. funds.
            </p>
            <p>A CERTIFIED BANK CHECK OR ASSOCIATION CHECK SHOULD BE USED.</p>

              other organizations that run 20-30 tournaments per year, we run 5
              tournaments. With more than enough applicants, we carefully place
              each team, where the objective of these larger tournament venues
              is to fill their tournaments with as many teams as possible.

              event. Schedules seldom change since we put our schedules through
              a rigorous approval process, not to mention that all teams have
              already paid in full, and we typically have a waiting list.
