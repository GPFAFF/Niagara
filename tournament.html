              <h3> We are more than just hockey!</h3>
              <h6> Why you should choose Niagara Sports Tournaments over all the others</h6>
              <h6> The answers are clear, read below to see more about us and the attractions, restaurants and exemplary service that we provide. </h6>
  
  <p>Gene Carella, NST Tournament Director, has been presenting tournament opportunities since 1990 for what was formerly known as Grand Niagara Cataracts Hockey Association. In 1999 he started Niagara Sport tournaments to help provide youth hockey to hundreds of teams throughout the U.S. and Canada per year.  Gene also raised four hockey players, and through his travels to many tournaments, he understands what hockey parents want. Gene and his son Michael put all teams through a rigorous screening process to ensure each team is placed in the proper division. Since there are many different classifications used by amateur hockey teams in different regions of the United States, and Canada, we at NST take the time and effort to create well balanced divisions. Nothing is more disheartening then driving to a tournament to blow out a team or get blown out by a team.  Teams also do not want to travel to a tournament just to be place in the same side of a division as team from their local leagues.  Gene and Mike take great pride in delivering an enjoyable tournament experience for our tournament families. This is evidenced by an incredible return rate in tournament participation by hockey associations. We only accept between 40-50 teams per tournament to ensure each division of each tournament has balanced competition.  We believe in quality over quantity when it comes to our tournaments.</p>
  <p>Niagara Sports Tournaments Inc. prides itself in offering a complete family mini vacation surrounding a first class, well managed, competitive hockey tournament. We will make the tournament registration/hotel selection process fast and easy for you.</p>
